# Ember-paper-ext

This project aims to make [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) components available that have not been officially implemented by [Ember Paper](https://github.com/miguelcobain/ember-paper). The goal is to build temporary components that closely follow Ember Paper and Angular Material conventions. This will ease a transition to officially supported components.
